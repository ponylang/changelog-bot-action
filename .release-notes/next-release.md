## Use Alpine 3.18 as our base image

Previously we were using Alpine 3.16. This should have no impact on anyone unless they are using this image as the base image for another.

## Handle Additional GitHub secondary rate limit failure

In our previous version, we added support for retrying when a secondary rate limit failure occurred. However, since that time, we have seen secondary rate limit failures that are not handled by the previous fix. This update adds a retry for the one time we know that the limit can be triggered. If the rate limit is triggered, the bot will wait for 30 seconds before trying again. If it encounters 5 failures, it will give up and quit.
