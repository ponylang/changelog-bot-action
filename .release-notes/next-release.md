## Improve resilience to GitHub API failures

When multiple repositories merge PRs at the same time, the bot could crash because GitHub drops connections instead of returning an error response. The bot now catches connection errors, staggers its start with a random delay to spread out concurrent runs, and uses exponential backoff between retries.

## Fix crash on unexpected GitHub error response format

When GitHub returned an error in an unexpected format, the bot could crash with a TypeError instead of retrying or reporting the original error.

## Retry on connection errors for all GitHub API calls

API calls outside the search loop (fetching the repo and pull request) could still crash on connection errors or rate limits. All GitHub API calls now retry with exponential backoff.
